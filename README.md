## What is Nuxtjs ?

- It is a framework designed to give you a strong architecture following official Vue guidelines. Incrementally adoptable, it can be used to create everything from static landing pages to complex enterprise ready web applications.
- It supports different targets (server, serverless or static) and server side rendering is switchable.
